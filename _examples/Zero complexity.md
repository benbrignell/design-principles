title: The Zero (0) Complexity Business IT Design principles
author: Maikel Mardjan 
overview: The zero complexity principles are meant to provide a reusable set of principles for business IT software projects. The standard defines crucial universal but practical principles to avoid business IT complexity.

principles:
- principle: Put People first!
summary: People are more important than what they produce. Aim to make people happy, healthy and feel safe. To prevent complexity in your product development you MUST put people before everything. Strive to help them to learn and grow by creating a safe environment for learning.

- principle: Only use what you understand
summary: Focus on the problem you want to solve and not on the so called tools that seems to provide a perfect solution. Given a hard complex problem, keep drilling until the problem is absolutely clear to you and then start working on the solution. Develop a structural way for introducing new innovative techniques in your organization.

- principle: Create a model of your solution
summary: To avoid complexity from the solution, create a model that simulates all the important effects before you start building your solution. Choose to create a model that not only you but also your stakeholders can understand. Keep iterating on the model by user testing, to solve the complexity of the model.

- principle: Define specific criteria that are tangible to measure complexity
summary: Define context specific rules of the required resources to steer your design process in order to avoid complexity.Use clear and simple explicit rules to create a checklist and avoid opinion based and implicit arguments on your checklist whenever possible.

- principle: Separation of concerns
summary: Solving problems in a simple way is hard. Too often we end up with very complex solutions for a simple problem. Separation of concerns means solving problems on the level where the problem is caused by creating autonomous SBBâ€™s (Solution Building Blocks).

- principle: Reduce all waste
summary: Remove all activities, documents, software code and even people that do not deliver value. Call it zero waste. Spending too much time, money or resources on hypothetic discussions will not give you a working product faster. Start building. Go for execution. Start a real life-pilot as fast as possible. Do not design everything in front. Call it a minimal viable product (MVP).

- principle: Problems should be fixed through simple solutions
summary: A simple solution is a solution where no configuration, maintenance or control is needed. Focus on clarity. Use simple solutions over complex solutions.

- principle: Design for change
summary: Keep your business process simple, so changes can be easily incorporated. Minimize the number of dependencies by minimizing testing efforts and business risks when introducing new functionality.

- principle: Make sure you can manage IT!
summary: Provide enough resources to prevent chaos. The management should be able to manage the important systems either automated or by human activities.

- principle: Privacy by design
summary: Respect for User Privacy. Do not store private data if it is not needed. Limiting data collection prevents risks on data leakage.

- principle: Never over engineer
summary: When your system will not get any simpler stop engineering. But never stop making it simpler. Prototype before polishing. First get it working, then simply, simplify and simplify.
